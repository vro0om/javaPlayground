Everything is public in kotlin buy default
Kotlin has method expressions


Classes (Signatory.kt)
No boiler plate code
All classes are final by default, therefore cannot be inherited from
To make a class inheritable use keyword open

class Person(val name : String, var age:Int)// val is final, var can be changed

open class Supe(name : String, age:Int) : Person(name,age)// derived classes donot need to define val or var for inherited parameters

init is called after the class initialization and complex initialization logics can be written in init block

primary constructor can be called from secondary constructor using this

no statics instead we have companion objects

Data classes have automatic implementations
    getter
    setters
    toString
    hashcode
    equlas
    copy

Instead of void kotlin has Unit

 ===================
 Functions as arguments (HigherOrderFunctions)
 use {} in the calling and pas a function inside it
 this is the way to implement strategy in kotlin effectively as every call can have different passed function

 Supported function constructs
 map
 flatmap
 fold
