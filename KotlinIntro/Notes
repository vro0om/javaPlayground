Everything is public in kotlin buy default
Kotlin has method expressions


Classes (Signatory.kt)
No boiler plate code
All classes are final by default, therefore cannot be inherited from
To make a class inheritable use keyword open

class Person(val name : String, var age:Int)// val is final, var can be changed

open class Supe(name : String, age:Int) : Person(name,age)// derived classes donot need to define val or var for inherited parameters

init is called after the class initialization and complex initialization logics can be written in init block
