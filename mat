several changes have been made to make the class immutable:

    The class is final. That means no subclasses can be created....
    The variables are all final and cannot be changed after construction.
    There are no setter methods for the members.

Difference between high cohesion and low cohesion:
Cohesion is the Object Oriented principle most closely associated with making sure that a class is designed with a single, well-focused purpose.
The more focused a class is, the cohesiveness of that class is more. The advantages of high cohesion is that such classes are much easier to maintain (and less frequently changed) 
than classes with low cohesion. Another benefit of high cohesion is that classes with a well-focused purpose tend to be more reusable than other classes. 

High cohesion is when you have a class that does a well defined job. Low cohesion is when a class does a lot of jobs that don’t have much in common.
High cohesion gives us better maintaining facility and Low cohesion results in monolithic classes that are difficult to maintain, understand and reduces re-usability

We can use Stream.of() to create a stream from similar type of data. 
For example, we can create Java Stream of integers from a group of int or Integer objects.
We can use Stream.of() with an array of Objects to return the stream
Stream<Integer> stream = Stream.of(new Integer[]{1,2,3,4}); 

A mutable builder for a Stream . This allows the creation of a Stream by generating elements individually and adding them to the Builder (without the copying overhead that comes from using an ArrayList as a temporary buffer.)


StringJoiner is mutable and non-synchronized

OPTIONS method of http is used to check for preflight request checking when the application is launch from the browser to check the origin is valid or not.


Interface segregation principle - A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
Ex - FAT interface
Open-closed Principle - Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

ConcurrentHashMap is best suited when you have multiple readers and few writers. If writers outnumber reader, or writer is equal to reader, than performance of ConcurrentHashMap effectively reduces to synchronized map or Hashtable. Performance of CHM drops, because you got to lock all portion of Map, and effectively each reader will wait for another writer, operating on that portion of Map. ConcurrentHashMap is a good choice for caches, which can be initialized during application start up and later accessed my many request processing threads. As javadoc states, CHM is also a good replacement of Hashtable and should be used whenever possible, keeping in mind, that CHM provides slightly weeker form of synchronization than Hashtable.


Cross-origin requests, in short, are HTTP requests where the origin and the target of the request are different. This is the case, for instance, when a web application is served from one domain and the browser sends an AJAX request to a server in another domain.

To manage cross-origin requests, the server needs to enable a particular mechanism known as CORS, or Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

The first step in CORS is an OPTIONS request to determine whether the target of the request supports it. This is called a pre-flight request.
